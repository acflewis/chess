A command line chess game with two modes
-- Play mode. Two players can either start a game from scratch, or load a previously saved game.
-- Watch mode. Famous/instructional chess games can be watched turn by turn in this mode. This repo contains several famous chess games. Additional games can be downloaded in PGN format (e.g. from chessgames.com) and placed in the PGN_files folder.

Known problems
-- In watch mode, if a pawn was taken en passent in the game watched, it will not be deleted
-- In play mode, the only draw implemented is stalemate
